# Autumn CafÃ© - Fixes Applied

## Date: October 17, 2025

### 1. âœ… Modal Backdrop Overlay Issue - FIXED
**Problem:** After closing modals, the backdrop remained, making the page unclickable.

**Solution:** Added backdrop cleanup event listeners to all modal instances:
```javascript
modalElement.addEventListener('hidden.bs.modal', function () {
    document.body.classList.remove('modal-open');
    document.querySelectorAll('.modal-backdrop').forEach(backdrop => backdrop.remove());
});
```

**Files Updated:**
- âœ… `resources/views/menu/index.blade.php`
- âœ… `resources/views/customers/index.blade.php`
- âœ… `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
- âœ… `resources/views/customer/cart/index.blade.php`
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/transactions/index.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/transactions/show.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/orders/index.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/orders/create.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/customer/auth/register.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/customer/auth/login.blade.php` (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ `resources/views/customer/menu/index.blade.php` (in progress)

### 2. âœ… Cart Page Modal Behavior - FIXED
**Problem:** Modal appeared on every quantity update, which was annoying.

**Solution:** 
- Changed session flash message key from `'success'` to `'cart_updated'` for quantity updates
- Modal only triggers on `session('success')` which is used for order confirmation
- Removed modal triggers for cart updates

**Controller Changes:**
- `CustomerMenuController@updateCart` - now uses `'cart_updated'` instead of `'success'`
- `CustomerMenuController@removeFromCart` - now uses `'cart_updated'` instead of `'success'`
- `CustomerMenuController@clearCart` - now uses `'cart_updated'` instead of `'success'`
- `CustomerMenuController@checkout` - still uses `'success'` for order confirmation

### 3. âœ… Storage Link - FIXED
**Problem:** Uploaded images were not accessible.

**Solution:** Created storage symbolic link:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

**Result:** Link created from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`

### 4. ðŸ“Š Database Storage Issues
**Status:** Needs Testing

**Verified:**
- âœ… All migrations are running successfully
- âœ… MenuItem model has correct fillable fields: `['name','slug','image','description','price','category','stock']`
- âœ… Order model has correct fillable fields: `['customer_id','total_amount','status','ordered_at']`
- âœ… OrderItem model has correct fillable fields: `['order_id','menu_item_id','quantity','unit_price','subtotal']`
- âœ… MenuItemController has correct validation and storage logic
- âœ… CustomerMenuController checkout method has proper transaction handling
- âœ… Storage link is now created for image uploads

**Next Steps:**
1. Test creating a menu item with image upload
2. Test customer registration and login
3. Test adding items to cart
4. Test placing an order
5. Verify data is saved in database

### 5. Cart Order Confirmation Redirect
**Status:** Should be working now with backdrop fix

**Controller Flow:**
```php
CustomerMenuController@checkout:
- Validates cart items
- Creates Order record
- Creates OrderItem records
- Updates menu item stock
- Clears cart from session
- Redirects to: route('customer.order.confirmation', $order->id)
- Flash message: session('success', 'Order placed successfully!')
```

**View:** `resources/views/customer/order/confirmation.blade.php` exists and displays order details.
